# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection

An educational project that demonstrates how to build a model to classify news articles as "real" or "fake" using **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

## ðŸš€ Objectives
- Understand the process of working with text data.
- Apply preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, stopword removal, and vectorization.
- Experiment with ML algorithms like **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, and **Random Forest**.
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as Accuracy and F1-Score.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `fake-news-detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step code.
- Dataset (can be downloaded from Kaggle or similar sources).
- Model training and evaluation results.

## ðŸ›  Requirements
To run the notebook, install the following Python libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn


```bash
## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset is not included in this repository due to file size limits.
